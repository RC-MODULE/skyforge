# What is it?

SkyForge is a high-level tool to create ready to boot debian root filesystems
using a simple Dockerfile-inspired syntax.

It uses multistrap to create a basic system and it's own configuration file called Skyfile to create a rootfs tarball

SkyForge assigns a hash to each of the steps it executes. If you are developing
your Skyfile and rerun the build only the actual commands that have changed will be re-run, thus saving you time and bandwidth. What's more skyforge captures the state of the rootfs at each step and makes sure that each command will be run exactly with the same rootfs as if the build had been started from scratch.

SkyForge uses ~~OverlayFS~~ UnionFS for fast snapshots (can be disabled with `--no-overlay` command option). If you don't have ~~OverlayFS~~ UnionFS, you can instruct SkyForge to tarball each and every state of the rootfs being made. Result will be roughly the same, but snapshots will consume a lot of time and disk space. See

```
skyforge tarball
```

# Installation

Just copy skyforge somewhere in your `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` ) and execute it as root.

Since multistrap tool requires root privileges so does this tool. You
are strongly adviced to use a disposable environment to run this tool, e.g. docker or a VM.

Since we are going to cook debian rootfs you should normally be running debian.
Ubuntu and derivatives might/likely will work, but I haven't  tested them myself.

# Commandline options

## `build`

Build rootfs from Skyfile in current directory.

```
skyforge build
```

If you don't have ~~OverlayFS~~ UnionFS building will not store snapshots on each step. If you don't have ~~OverlayFS in your kernel~~ UnionFS but still want the snapshot feature run


```
skyforge tarball
skyforge build
```

## `tarball`
Enables tarballing of each of the steps run. This will persist until you run `skyforge purge`. See `build` section for more

## `clean`

Remove old snapshots from working directory (`.forge`) and leave only those
actually present in the Skyfile

```
skyforge clean
```

Skyforge does cleaning every time it is executed, so you normally don't need to
run it manually

## `purge`

Remove all intermediate junk created by Skyforge.
Equivalent of running `rm -Rf .forge` (and removind artifacts).

## `mount`

When running with ~~OverlayFS~~ UnionFS available this command mounts the `rootfs/` at the last snapshot and prints out history like `status` does

## `status`

Prints out current action log including Skyfile lines and their hashes.
Each line of Skyfile is identified by a hash.
Inserting a line before it changes the hashes of all lines following it.

Legend:

### `[S]`

Skyforge will skip this step, it has already been run/we have a snapshot

### `[R]`

Skyforge will execute this step when you run build

## `reset <hash>`

Reset filesystem to state before executing step with `<hash>`. This step amd following will ne reruned on next build.

Example

```
skyforge reset b1fabddf2afd249fc0a6cb6197ce3e6b
```

## `rebuild`

Equal to run `skyforge purge` and `skyforge build` sequentially.

# A summary of available Skyfile commands

## `MULTISTRAP <debarch> <config-file> (RETRY_WITH <Skyfile command>)`

Runs multistrap with the supplied debarch (e.g. `armel`) using the config file supplied. Should be the first command to run. This step also makes sure an adequate qemu-static binary is copied to target chroot. (e.g. `qemu-arm-static` for `arm`).

If part with `RETRY_WITH` exist then on multistrap fail provided command will be executed and multistrap try to run again.

NOTE: Since debian architecture names are not always mapped one-to-one to qemu architecture names this script takes care to guess the right one. This logic currently covers `arm`, `mips` and `x86/x86_64` variants. If you have something else - patches are welcome.

```
MULTISTRAP armel debian-armel.conf
```

## `DPKG_CONFIGURE (<mode>)`

Runs the steps required to configure the unpacked packages in chroot.
This command does the following:

1. Prohibits the start of any services via `policy-rc.d`  
~~2. Runs the dash.preinst script (As described in debian wiki)~~
3. Runs `dpkg --configure -a` in chroot
4. Allows service startup

The default behavior is interactive (e.g. allow `dpkg-configure` to ask different
questions). If this is not desired, supply the silent argument.
If you want to other variables you can do it here as well.

Configure packages, ask no questions
```
DPKG_CONFIGURE noninteractive
```
or
```
DPKG_CONFIGURE DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive DEBCONF_NONINTERACTIVE_SEEN=true
```

Configure packages, ask questions about system setup
```
DPKG_CONFIGURE
```
or
```
DPKG_CONFIGURE interactive
```

## `DENY_SERVICE_START`

Prohibits any services to be started in the target root filesystem via `policy-rc.d`

## `ALLOW_SERVICE_START`

Undos what DENY_SERVICE_START has done

## `INCLUDE Skyfile`

Include a Skyfile script.

```
INCLUDE Skyfile.inc
```

## `INSTALL <filename> <target_path>`

Copies a file from host operating system to target

```
INSTALL /etc/resolv.conf /etc
```

## `RUN <command>`

Runs a command in chrooted environment. If you have a cross-chroot and that doesn't work check if you have `qemu-user-static` installed and that `MULTISTRAP` command actually copied the right one to your chroot.

```
RUN uname -a
```

## `REMOVE <filename>`

Delete a file from target root filesystem

```
REMOVE /etc/resolv.conf
```

## `ADD_DEB <package>`

Install a debian package to target rootfs the package can be either a local file or an URL

```
    ADD_DEB https://example.com/myfile.deb
    ADD_DEB myotherfile.deb
```

## `ADD_PACKAGES <pkg1> (<pkg2> ...)`

Call apt-get to install additional packages. Use of this command is not recommended. Edit `multistrap.conf` instead.

```
ADD_PACKAGES usb-utils
```

## `STORE <filename>`

Tarball the root filesystem into the archive filename.
The archive generated will be deleted if you run `skyforge purge`

```
STORE rootfs.tar.gz
```

## `PASSWD <password>`

Setup root password on the target system.

```
PASSWD 12345678
```

## `HOSTNAME <hostname>`

Setup hostname on the target root filesystem

```
HOSTNAME iltharia
```

## `LOCALE <primary_locale> (<secondary_locales> ...)`

Add locale to `/etc/locale.gen` and generate locales on the target. Additionally set LANG and LANGUAGE to `primary_locale`.

```
LOCALE en_US.UTF8 UTF8
```

## `IFACE_STATIC <iface> <ip> <netmask> <gateway> <nameserver>`

Configure ethernet interface parameters (static IP)

```
IFACE_STATIC eth0 192.168.20.9 255.255.255.0 192.168.20.1 8.8.8.8
```

## `IFACE_DHCP <iface>`

Configure ethernet interface with DHCP

```
IFACE_DHCP eth0
```

## `APT_KEY <url>`

Add an apt gpg key into the target rootfs

```
APT_KEY http://www.module.ru/mb7707/repo/repository.gpg
```
## `SH <command>`

Just run a shell command in this directory.
You can omit SH and it will still work the same. Magic!

```
SH ls rootfs/
```
and

```
ls rootfs/
```

are essentially the same

## `SYMLINK2COPY`

Replace all symlinks in the root filesystem with file copies. This bloats the filesystem but is sometimes the only choice if you want to use the rootfs as a
sysroot for development in a windows-environment that (sic!) doesn't play with symlinks well.

```
SYMLINK2COPY
```
## `SYMLINK2RELATIVE`

Replace all symlinks containing absolute paths in the root filesystem with
symlinks containing relative paths. This is required if you plan to use the resulting rootfs as a development sysroot (Because unpacking this filesystem anywhere save for / will corrupt relative symlinks)
```
SYMLINK2RELATIVE
```

## `LDSOFIXUP`

Concatenate contents of rootfs/etc/ld.so.conf.d into one ld.so.conf
This is usually required if you plan to use the rootfs as a sysroot with linaro abe-based crooss toolchains that don't read properly the contents of `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`
If you plan to actually boot the system - you don't need this one.

## `ADD <filename.tgz> <dir>`

Unpack the filename.tgz into the `rootfs/<dir>` directory.

```
ADD stuff.tgz /
ADD cross-compiler.tgz /opt
```

## `ARTIFACT <filename>`

Mark filename as a build artifact. The only effect this has - this file will be
removed when you run skyforge purge
